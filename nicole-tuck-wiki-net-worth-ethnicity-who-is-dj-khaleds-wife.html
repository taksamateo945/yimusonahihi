Nicole Tuck Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Nicole Tuck was born in the USA, on 7 December 1975, so under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and holding American nationality – she rose to prominence after she married DJ Khaled.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Not much is known about Nicole’s early life, as she hasn’t shared many details regarding her personal matters with the public including parents and any siblings.</p><p>She attended a public high school, and was mostly focused on her studies while also finding time to spend with her peers and attend parties with them. After she matriculated from high school, Nicole decided to further work on her education and enrolled at the Marymount Manhattan College, from where she obtained her bachelor’s degree, then went on to obtain her master’s degree from Fordham University.</p><p>It is not known if Nicole dated anyone during the years she spent at high school and at university while it is known that she met DJ Khaled soon after her graduation – the two started dating before Khaled became popular, and their relationship and later marriage have survived through all the obstacles.</p><h2><span id=Life_after_graduation>Life after graduation</span></h2><p>Not much is known about Nicole’s life after she got her master’s degree as it is not even known what the subject of her studies was. She is said to be interested in fashion, and has worked as a manager of numerous clothing stores – she has recently launched her own clothing line called ABU Apparel, with the help of her husband DJ Khaled.</p><p>As her husband is a very popular DJ in the US, and therefore in the spotlight of entertainment, her career is in the shadow of his, no matter how successful she manages to become – she has allegedly been trying to make her way into the film industry for two years now, but hasn’t been successful yet. As she and her husband have a son together named Asahd Khaled, Nicole hasn’t had time to focus on her career, but has rather become a housewife and is taking care of her son.</p><h2><span id=Marriage_with_DJ_Khaled_and_other_relationships>Marriage with DJ Khaled and other relationships</span></h2><p>Nicole is a bit secretive when it comes to her love life, and hasn’t shared many details regarding her and her husband’s life together, but as he is a very popular person in the US, some things are still known.</p><p>The two met shortly after Nicole graduated from college, but it’s not known when or how – they fell in love while DJ Khaled’s career was not yet launched. They were dating for numerous years and she was by his side as he was becoming more popular in the music industry. While it often happens that people change with fame, this was not the case with DJ Khaled, who has remained loyal to Nicole who was there to support him when he needed her the most, and when she gave birth to their son Asahd Tuck Khaled on 23 October 2016 – they exchanged their wedding vows before this but the exact date is not known. DJ Khaled bought Robbie Williams’ house in Mulholland Estates in Los Angeles, while they later moved to waterfront home in Miami in 2018 for which he reputedly paid $25.9 million.</p><p>Nicole hasn’t talked about any other men she might have dated before DJ Khaled, presumably as she doesn’t want to make her husband jealous – there havaey’t been no controversies or rumors surrounding their marriage.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_DJ_Khaled>Who is DJ Khaled?</span></h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>DJ Khaled</a> was born in New Orleans, Louisiana USA, on 6 November 1975, so under the zodiac sign of Scorpio and holding American nationality – he is a DJ, record executive, songwriter, record producer, and a social media star.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/main/thumbs/1722577_DJ-Khaled.jpg></p><p>DJ Khaled started off as a radio host in the 1990s, working for the “99 Jamz” Miami hip hop station – after the “Terror Squad” rap group heard his performances, they hired him as their DJ. This helped him gain recognition, and he eventually released his first album entitled “Listennn… the Album” in 2006 which soon became gold certified.</p><p>He went on to release albums “We the Best” in 2007, “We Global” in 2008, and “Victory” in 2010 – all of these albums ranked in the top 10 of the US Billboard 200, while his single “All I Do Is Win” was certified platinum three times. His “We the Best Forever” album in 2011 helped him to become popular worldwide – he released his next two albums “Kiss the Ring” and “Suffering from Success” in 2012 and 2013, and “I Changed a Lot” in 2015.</p><p>He rose to fame on the internet in January 2016, which led to the released of his ninth album “Major Key” in the same year – this album won him a Grammy nomination for the best rap album. His tenth album “Grateful” was released in 2017, and his “Father of Asahd” album followed in 2019 reaching #2 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>While DJ Khaled is mostly focused on making music, he is somewhat of a writer as well as he has written “The Keys” which has since become a bestseller – while he is not much of an actor, he has nevertheless managed to appear in “Spies in Disguise” movie shot in 2019 and will appear in “Bad Boys for Life” in 2020.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Nicole has numerous interests and hobbies and always finds some free time to do the things she loves.</p><p>She is very fond of partying, and her husband has nothing against it, on the contrary, he likes the fact that his wife often goes to clubs at which he performs. She’s proud to upload <a rel=nofollow href=#>pictures of their son</a> onto her Instagram account, while she is also a big fan of quotes of thoughtful people as she often uploads these quotes as well. She enjoys the water, which is why summer is her favorite season – she spends most of her free time during summer at the beaches together with her husband and son, however, as her husband is busy most of the time, she has no problem going to the beach alone with her son.</p><p>Nicole was into travelling during her 20s and 30s, but has stopped after giving birth.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Nicole is currently 43 years old. She has long curly brown hair and brown eyes while her height and weight are not known.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, her current net worth is estimated to be more than $50,000 and is mostly rising thanks to her clothing line, while her husband’s net worth is estimated to be more than $35 million (it was $3 million in 2013), in which she no doubt shares.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Nicole is more or less active on the internet – ‘more’ because she is very active on Instagram and Facebook, and ‘less’ because she doesn’t use the Twitter network.</p><p>Her <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram account</a> is followed by more than 27,000 people, while she’s uploaded over 370 pictures onto it, and she is running a Facebook profile, but only uses it to keep in touch with her friends and family.</p><p>Her husband DJ Khaled is a lot more popular than her, as his <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram account</a> has more than 16 million people following him, while he’s uploaded nearly 30,000 pictures onto it.</p><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=General_Info><span id=General_info>General Info</span></span></h2><table readability=7.5><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>DJ Khaled</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 million dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 26, 1975</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Died</td><td>August 18, 2015, Palmyra, Syria</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5ft 6in</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Rapper, Disc jockey, Songwriter, Radio personality, Do You Mind, Hold You Down, All I Do Is Win</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Family><span id=General_info>Family</span></span></h2><table><tr><td>Children</td><td>Asahd Tuck Khaled</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Nicole Tuck, Nicole Tuck</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Accomplishments><span id=Accomplishments>Accomplishments</span></span></h2><table readability=12><tr readability=12><td>Awards</td><td>BET Hip Hop Award for Hustler of the Year, BET Hip Hop Award for MVP of the Year, BET Hip Hop Award for Best DJ of the Year, BET Hip Hop Award for Best Collabo, Duo or Group, Shorty Award for Snapchatter of the Year, Do You Mind, Hold You Down, All I Do Is Win</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Terror Squad</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance, BET Hip Hop Award for Best Track of the Year, BET Award for Best Collaboration, BET Hip Hop Award for People's Champ, BET Hip Hop Award for Best Hip Hop Video, BET Hip Hop Award for Best Club Banger, iHeartRadio Music Award...</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Shottas</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Voice</td></tr></table><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Social_profile_links><span id=Social_profile_links>Social profile links</span></span></h2><h2 class=tabtitle><span id=Quotes><span id=Quotes>Quotes</span></span></h2><table class=quotes readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Major key.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You smart.

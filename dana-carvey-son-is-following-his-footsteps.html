He has been married to his wife Paula Zwagerman for more than 37 years. Aside from being a married pair, the couple is also the happy parents of two kids, Dex Carvey and Thomas Carvey. After his children were born, he left Hollywood and removed his children from the spotlight. But why did he make that choice?</p><h2>He didn’t want to leave his children.</h2><p>During the 1990s, Dana was at the pinnacle of his profession, so much so that he had to leave his house for months.&nbsp;Carvey, on the other hand, did not want to leave his family after the birth of his children. Dex, his first son, was born in 1991, and his second son was born in 1993.&nbsp;He found it strange to entrust his children to a nanny. As a result, the actor accompanied the children to whatever film sets he was working on.</p><p>The comedian once brought his children to the set of the film Trapped in Paradise. In an interview with Looper, he said that he couldn’t leave them due to illness.&nbsp;One youngster had many ear infections, while the other had the flu. I’d sleep for a few hours, then attempt to keep one of my boys entertained in the basement by dragging this cart about. It was inconvenient for him to take his children to the sets. Carvey described an amusing occurrence in a 2009 interview with AV Club. He said that when shooting Wayne’s World 2, one of his sons came up to him, urged him not to have odd hair, and sobbed.&nbsp;Those two experiences made him understand how important it was for him to devote his complete attention to his family. So he left Hollywood and relocated to Northern California with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dana-Carvey-2.jpg><h2>Sons Follow in His Steps</h2><p>Even though the Wayne’s World actor kept his kids, Dex and Thomas Carvey, away from Hollywood and the limelight, his boys expressed an interest in stand-up comedy. When Carvey recognized his kids’ talent, he relocated to Los Angeles and assisted them in launching their own comedic careers.</p><p>He is now proud of his boys and constantly discusses their progress. On December 2, 2016, for example, in The Secret Life of Pets, voice actor Kevin Smith shared a video of his son Dex from his Netflix special presentation. Meanwhile, on September 12, 2018, Dana and his two boys were seen together on the stage of The Ridgefield Playhouse for The “Humans Are Fantastic” tour, which was part of the Barts Tree Service Comedy series. Dana’s sons, Dex and Thomas, are Twitch streamers in addition to being comedians. They operate The Carvey Brothers, a joint Twitch channel. Dex has also been a Twitch.TV has partnered with broadcasters since 2017.</p><h2>Carvey had two marriages.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dana-Carvey-1.jpg alt="Dana Carvey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dana was Dana’s birth name. Thomas Carvey, an American actor and comedian, has exchanged wedding vows twice in his life. He married Leah Carvey for the first time in 1979. They divorced in 1980.&nbsp;Dana married his current wife, Paula Zwagerman, three years after his divorce from his first wife. The pair has always been together since then.&nbsp;Dana’s wife, Paula, is often seen with her husband at award presentations such as the Annual American Comedy Awards and the Academy Awards. They attended the 91st Annual Academy Awards on February 24, 2019, in Hollywood, California.&nbsp;Dana’s choice to leave Hollywood to concentrate on his family paid off, since his children desired to be comedians.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmqaRYrCivtWesGarn6N6qr%2BMn6alpJ%2Bstq%2BzjKGgrGWWpLy1v9Oep6xn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html&text=Dana%20Carvey%20Son%20Is%20Following%20His%20Footsteps&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html&title=Dana%20Carvey%20Son%20Is%20Following%20His%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html&title=Dana%20Carvey%20Son%20Is%20Following%20His%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html&title=Dana%20Carvey%20Son%20Is%20Following%20His%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdana-carvey-son-is-following-his-footsteps.html&description=Dana%20Carvey%20Son%20Is%20Following%20His%20Footsteps" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./demi-lovato-covers-sam-smith-live-lounge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Demi Lovato covers Sam Smith's 'Too Good At Goodbyes' on Radio 1's Live Lounge">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cribbage-jack-crossword-clue-thomas-joseph-1145100.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cribbage jack Crossword Clue Thomas Joseph">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

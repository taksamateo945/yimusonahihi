Once again, we’ve been completely spoilt for choice when it comes to new music over the past seven days.</p><p>This week saw new album releases from&nbsp;<a href=#>Pink</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Scouting For Girls</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>The Tide</a>, all of which we’ve had on repeat all week. In terms of new singles, leading this week’s offerings were <a href=#>Louis Tomlinson</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jonas Blue and Moelogo</a>, <a href=#>Emily Warren</a> and <a href=#>Mackenzie Ziegler</a>.</p><p>Fans of The X Factor were left delighted this week when&nbsp;<a href=#>Matt Terry,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Ben Haenow,</a> <a href=#>Sam Lavery</a> and <a href=#>Ruth Lorenzo</a> and <a href=#>Laura White</a> (featuring on SKIY’s new single) dropped their new offerings. New music also came from the likes of&nbsp;<a href=#>Mason Ashley</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Gabi Sklar</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Lennon Stella and Barnes Courtney</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Victoria Celestine,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Felix Jaehn</a>.</p><p>As usual, we’ve still got some more new tracks to share with you. Here’s what else you should be adding onto your playlists this week!</p><h4>The Vamps and Maggie Lindemann – ‘Personal’</h4><p>The Vamps have teamed up with Maggie Lindemann for their latest single, ‘Personal’, the first track to be taking from their forthcoming <a href=#>Night and Day (Day Edition)</a> album. The track has a cool vibe, with Maggie’s vocals blending with the band perfectly. Speaking about working together, The Vamps said: “We always enjoy working with new people. When we heard Maggie’s tune ‘Pretty Girl’ we knew she was going to be awesome. She’s such a talented person whose voice added so much to the single. She’s not just a pretty girl ;)”.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie added, “I love the song and the meaning behind it –&nbsp;I think everyone has gone through it.&nbsp;&nbsp;My manager and I were on our way to Norway and he played me a very rough demo of the song that only had Brad on it. I thought the concept was so cool! We recorded it a couple of weeks later. The Vamps were amazing to work with, super good energy all the time. They’re cool guys!”</p><h4>Lost Kings – ‘First Love’ featuring Sabrina Carpenter</h4><p>After teaming up with Fifth Harmony’s Ally Brooke and Tinashe in the past, Lost Kings are back with another incredible offering with showcases another phenomenal female vocalist. This time, it’s Sabrina Carpenter’s turn, who has been busy wowing audiences globally with her solo material. ‘First Love’ is a captivating dance pop offering which will resonate with anyone who has experienced a first love. Speaking about the collaboration, Lost Kings said: “We had such a great time with Sabrina…so we really wanted to capture that energy and have it translate in the video. The feeling of falling in love for the first time is so raw and it’s something that everyone can relate to, so we also wanted the video to have that feeling, as well.”</p><p></p><h4>Cheat Codes – ‘Feels Great’ featuring Fetty Wap and CVBZ</h4><p>Following on from their global smash hit, ‘No Promises’ featuring Demi Lovato, Cheat Codes are back with a new track called ‘Feels Great’. Teaming up with Fetty Wap and CVBZ, the song will have you pining for the summer months. Described by the band as a “version of a John Hughes movie in song form,” Cheat Codes added that “Everybody loves to look back at the glory days, but being young is just a state of mind. Fetty&nbsp;joining us on this song is the icing on the cake. We’re label partners with him and we played a show with him in Texas a few months back. This dude always has a smile on his face, so when we originally had the demo of the song we immediately thought he’d be perfect on it.”</p><h4>Julie Elody – ‘The Lighthouse’</h4><p>After spending many years in a rock band, alternative pop artist Julie Elody continues to explore her new electronic pop sound with ‘The Lighthouse’. The track has a hypnotic quality and showcases Julie’s captivating vocal. Speaking about the track, Julie said:&nbsp;“I think we all have moments where we feel unhinged and ‘The Lighthouse’ is a song about being okay with being a little broken.&nbsp; My favorite line from the song is “there’s a lighthouse in this room I watched it go dark.&nbsp; But there are matches everywhere what distracting spark.” &nbsp;Even when everything feels like it’s falling apart, there’s always another way.&nbsp; It may not be the healthiest thing to do, but we do what we need to do to survive and sometimes that’s enough.”</p><h4>ABISHA – ‘All That’</h4><p>Making her debut with ‘All That’, ABISHA is a British alt-R&B singer-songwriter who is ready to take on the music scene with her moody&nbsp;melodies and distinctive vocal. ‘All That’ is an alternative slow-burner which gives us a taste of what we can expect from the 22-year-old. Speaking about the track, ABISHA <a href=#>said that</a> ‘All That’ is “a literal song. It speaks so openly about being torn between two love interests and eventually having to make a decision. It’s not a nice situation or topic, but it happened. It’s so straight up. The track was written and finished within a day because the lyrics are literally just the thoughts straight out of my head. Sometimes I think that things happen to you in life and you don’t see the greater meaning or purpose until way after, when you’ve stepped out of the situation.”</p><h4>Skye Wallace – ‘Scarlet Fever’</h4><p>‘Scarlet Fever’ is the new single from Skye Wallace, which gives us a taste of what we can expect from her next full length release due in 2018. The guitar-led track is full of energy and has been accompanied by a video which reflects the song’s content. Speaking to <a href=#>Noisey</a> about the track, Skye said:&nbsp;“I wrote ‘Scarlet Fever’ about a love story set in the Yukon. After a winter apart, Scarlet is arriving in the Dawson City harbour by boat and her lover awaits on land, petrified with uncertainty over the state of their&nbsp;<span class=skimlinks-unlinked>devotion.The</span>&nbsp;song’s energy evokes the messy turmoil of love and lust, and the music video, directed by Nathanael Vass, reflects the jittery, sexy, maddening thrill that comes with it.”</p><p></p><h4>Fickle Friends x Hannah Jane Lewis – ‘Raincheck’</h4><p>Whilst&nbsp;<a href=#>Hannah Jane Lewis</a>&nbsp;is enjoying success with her latest single ‘Raincheck’, the track has already been given an additional lease of life thanks to a remix from Fickle Friends’ Jack. Adding an extra sparkle to the glittering song, the remix further highlight’s the song’s anthemic quality. Speaking about the remix, Hannah said: “I’m a big fan of Fickle Friends’ music, so I was super excited when Jack said he would remix my single ‘Raincheck’. he’s taken it in a totally different direction and played around with the vocals and rhythms – which I absolutely love!”</p><h4>Angel – ‘Take You Home’</h4><p>Following a string of sold-out headline shows earlier this year and the launch of his ‘More of HER’ playlist, the dynamic UK R&B singer Angel is back with the release of his new single ‘Take You Home’, the first track to be taken from his forthcoming album WOMAN. Paying homage to iconic 90s R&B and hip-hop jams including Foxy Brown ft Blackstreet – ‘Get Me Home’ and SWV’s ‘I’m So Into You’, Angel once again pulls you in with his signature mix of addictive throwback influences. Combined with his distinctive, soulful vocals and unparalleled songwriting and production talents, ‘Take You Home’ is the perfect introduction to his highly anticipated full length project.</p><h4>What was your favourite new music release this week?

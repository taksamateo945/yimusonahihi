KonekoKitten is famous for his self-titled YouTube channel and gained massive popularity for their Roblox discussions, playthroughs, streams, and mod reviews.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>KonekoKitten is <strong>22 years old.</strong>&nbsp;He was born on <strong>December 18, 1998</strong>, in Florida. He was born and raised in Florida. Likewise, his birth sign is Sagittarius and there is no information regarding his parents. Moreover, his real name is Brian and he is famous as a Youtube gamer and commentator.</p><p>Likewise, he belongs to Mexican nationality, and ethnicity is still unknown. However, there is no information regarding his educational background too. He has a twin brother named Chase.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Talking about KonekoKitten’s professional life, he is a Roblox player. He created his self titled Youtube channel in April 2016. Likewise, he has seen their YouTube channel grow to boast more than 320,000 subscribers.</p><p>Some of his most popular videos have included “HARDEST SONG IN ROBERTS | (FREEDOM DiVE) | LVL 30 [A]” and “fortnite, but made by 12-year-olds on Roblox.” He keeps on posting videos regarding Roblox discussions, playthroughs, streams, and mod reviews.</p><p>Further, he has also a second YouTube account under the name KonekoTalks which is now inactive. And he has even launched a third channel called “Koneko”. He uploads games other than just Roblox content, in a similar way to how they do it on their Roblox channel. Recently, he has been uploading a lot of Minecraft (specifically Hypixel Skyblock) on this channel.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-13327 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Konekokitten-game-character.jpg alt=Konekokitten width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-13327 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Konekokitten’s youtube game characters. Source: Roblox</p><h4>Net worth</h4><p>Talented KonekoKitten has earned a decent sum of money through his Youtube career. However, he has not disclosed his net worth as well as an annual salary. Nevertheless, according to the statsmash, KonekoKitten’s <strong>net worth</strong> as of January 2020 is $1.6 million.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_status>Relationship status</span></h2><p>Reflecting on KonekoKitten’s relationship status, he might be single. But as per some reliable resources, he is in a relationship with musical artist Naku/Squiblers who is famous as miskeeping on YouTube. However, he has not confirmed about it.</p><p>In a Q&A on Twitter but answered on YouTube, he confirmed that he is pansexual. He is currently busy with his Youtube career. However, he neither has children. He seems to be waiting for his perfect match.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>Previously, he was once about to be banned from Roblox. KonekoKitten has got some resentment due to Cyrillic and special usernames being reset shortly after a video about the subject on his channel. Due to this, he performed a video about the reset asserting that it was a coincidence that the usernames were reset around the same time he posted the original video about special usernames.</p><p>One user-watched his video and announced the Cyrillic usernames to the Roblox team, likely through roblox.com/support or <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=a0c9cec6cfe0d2cfc2cccfd88ec3cfcd>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, which terminated resetting maël4000, Vexillogic, and any future Cyrillic username, or that a Roblox staff member saw the video and reset the usernames themselves. A lot of other usernames also pretended as a result of the video.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_and_Social_Media>Body Measurements and Social Media</span></h2><p>Details about KonekoKitten’s body measurements like height, weight, chest-waist-hip measurement, etc are not available. However, he often has long black curly hair when we see him on youtube videos. Furthermore, he also has black eyes.</p><p>KonekoKitten is socially less active on media sites like Instagram, Twitter, etc. and does not have a Twitter account. He has collected many fan followings. Likewise, he has around followers on 22 k Instagram and more than 39k followers on Twitter. Further, he has over 888 k subscribers on his Youtube channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCmmaOge6S7zGiiqKaVoLystdOtnKdn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkonekokitten.html&text=Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20In%20Relation%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Wiki&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkonekokitten.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkonekokitten.html&title=Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20In%20Relation%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkonekokitten.html&title=Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20In%20Relation%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkonekokitten.html&title=Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20In%20Relation%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkonekokitten.html&description=Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20In%20Relation%2c%20Nationality%2c%20Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cassie-jo-stoddart-boyfriend-matt-beckham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Cassie Jo Stoddart?

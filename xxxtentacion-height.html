Onfroy, was born in Plantation, Florida, on January 23rd, 1998.</p><p>Growing up in Lauderhill, Florida, he began crafting music at a tender age.</p><p>Subsequently, he unveiled his debut single, “Look at Me!”, in late 2015, and it swiftly garnered immense popularity, launching him into stardom.</p><p>Before his unfortunate passing in 2018, Xxxtentacion introduced two studio albums, specifically “17” and “?”.</p><p>Notably, his music fused rap, rock, and metal, forging a style that was undeniably unique.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Xxxtentacion attracted attention with his provocative lyrics and tumultuous personal life.</p><p>He confronted legal challenges, including charges related to assaulting a pregnant woman, and was awaiting trial at the time of his demise.</p><p>Despite the controversies, his music cultivated a global fanbase.</p><p>His untimely death in June 2018 had a profound impact on both the music industry and his legion of devoted followers.</p><p>At the time of his passing, Xxxtentacion stood at a <strong>height of 5 feet 7 inches</strong> and endured a challenging childhood, frequently engaging in fights.</p><img

id=Xxxxtentacions_Personal_Life><strong>Xxxxtentacion’s Personal Life</strong></span></h2><p>At just 6 years old, he used a piece of glass to protect his mom from what he saw as a threat.</p><p>Consequently, he even got expelled from middle school for hitting a kid who made fun of his mom.</p><p>Transitioning to his early interest in music, his mom signed him up for a choir, but he didn’t fit in because he disliked learning notes.</p><p>This led to his expulsion from the choir, as he punched another member during a performance.</p><p>These events contributed to a complicated relationship with his mom, who eventually kicked him out when he was barely a teenager.</p><p>He then moved in with his grandmother during his teenage years, which exposed him to troubled activities like robberies.</p><p>During a stint in jail lasting a year, he crossed paths with a talented rapper named Ski Mask the Slump God.</p><p>This meeting fostered a close bond.</p><p>And upon their release, they joined forces with Wifisfuneral and Craig Xen to create the rap group known as Members Only.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-hISIghYe/</p><p>In 2014, he uploaded his first song, “Vice City,” on SoundCloud.</p><p>In 2015, he released two albums, “Members Only Vol. 1” and “Members Only Vol. 2,” with Ski Mask the Slump God.</p><p>Subsequently, he faced multiple arrests in 2016 for various charges, and after some time in jail, he was released in April 2017.</p><p>During this time, one of his songs, “Look at Me,” became a hit in 2016 and gained even more popularity when re-released in 2017, making it to the US Billboard chart.</p><p>Unfortunately, his ex-girlfriend accused him of physically assaulting her in 2016.</p><p>Furthermore, he initiated a gaming YouTube channel that amassed 5.5 million subscribers and had a feud with Drake in 2017 over a song similarity.</p><p>In May 2017, he released his first album, ‘Revenge,’ consisting of eight previously released mixtape tracks.</p><p>Tragically, on June 18, 2018, he was fatally shot by armed robbers while leaving a motorsports store in Broward County, Florida.</p><p>The funeral of the performer was held in Florida on June 27.</p><p>Additionally, Ax’s mother revealed that her deceased son’s girlfriend was pregnant, substantiating this with an ultrasound scan of the fetus.</p><h2><span
